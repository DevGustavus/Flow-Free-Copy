<h1 align="center">Flow-Free-Copy</h1>

## üìñ About the project
This project was inspired by the game Flow Free from Duck Duck Games, but not only that, it is also part of the extension project for the 4th semester of ADS (Analysis and Systems Development) at IFTM-CAUPT, which will be presented at IFEX. <br>
The student developers of the application used Kotlin as the development language, and the Android Studio as the IDE.

#### How does the game work?

Flow is a game that involves connecting colored dots on a board, filling the entire board without allowing the lines to cross.
